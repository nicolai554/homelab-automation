## Objective
Configure a service account with restricted sudo privileges for automated service restarts.

## Configuration

### Sudoers Entry
```
deploy-bot ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart testapp.service
```

## Testing Results
```bash
#  Allowed operation (no password required)
deploy-bot@rhcsa:~$ sudo systemctl restart testapp.service
deploy-bot@rhcsa:~$ echo $?
0

#  Blocked: Root escalation
deploy-bot@rhcsa:~$ sudo su -
Sorry, user deploy-bot is not allowed to execute '/bin/su -' as root

#  Blocked: Different service
deploy-bot@rhcsa:~$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
Sorry, user deploy-bot is not allowed to execute '/bin/systemctl restart sshd' as root
```

## Security Principles
- Least privilege access
- No password storage for automation
- Command path restriction prevents attacks
- Limited blast radius on account compromise
